	abstract = {Visualization is frequently used to aid our interpretation of complex datasets. Within microbial genomics, visualizing the relationships between multiple genomes as a tree provides a framework onto which associated data (geographical, temporal, phenotypic and epidemiological) are added to generate hypotheses and to explore the dynamics of the system under investigation. Selected static images are then used within publications to highlight the key findings to a wider audience. However, these images are a very inadequate way of exploring and interpreting the richness of the data. There is, therefore, a need for flexible, interactive software that presents the population genomic outputs and associated data in a user-friendly manner for a wide range of end users, from trained bioinformaticians to front-line epidemiologists and health workers. Here, we present Microreact, a web application for the easy visualization of datasets consisting of any combination of trees, geographical, temporal and associated metadata. Data files can be uploaded to Microreact directly via the web browser or by linking to their location (e.g. from Google Drive/Dropbox or via {API}), and an integrated visualization via trees, maps, timelines and tables provides interactive querying of the data. The visualization can be shared as a permanent web link among collaborators, or embedded within publications to enable readers to explore and download the data. Microreact can act as an end point for any tool or bioinformatic pipeline that ultimately generates a tree, and provides a simple, yet powerful, visualization method that will aid research and discovery and the open sharing of datasets.},

	abstract = {Coronaviruses ({CoVs}) belong to the family of Coronaviridae, the order Nidovirales, and the genus Coronavirus. They are the largest group of viruses causing respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Morphologically, {CoVs} are enveloped viruses containing a non-segmented positive-sense, single-stranded ribonucleic acid ({RNA}) viruses. {CoVs} are categorized into four important genera that include Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. A novel member of human {CoV} that has recently emerged in Wuhan, China, is now formally named as {SARS}-{CoV}-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). This is a unique strain of {RNA} viruses that have not been previously observed in humans. The virus has wide host adaptability and is capable of causing severe diseases in humans, masked palm civets, mice, dogs, cats, camels, pigs, chickens, and bats. The {SARS}-{CoV}-2 typically causes respiratory and gastrointestinal sickness in both humans and animals. It can be transmitted through aerosols and direct/indirect contact, as well as during medical cases and laboratory sample handling. Specific structural proteins, which might be found on the surface of the virus, play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of the complications. The disease is characterized by distinct medical signs and symptoms that include high fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing. The infected people may also present with other symptoms such as diarrhea, myalgia, fatigue, expectoration, and hemoptysis. It is important from the public health and economic point of view as it affects the growth of the country, which is majorly attributed to the restriction in the movement of the people and the cost associated with the control and prevention of the disease. Since there is no specific therapeutic intervention nor a vaccine available against the virus, supportive management and treatment with non-specific therapeutic agents (repurposed drugs) may provide relief to the patients. Some preventive strategies of the disease include blocking the routes of transmission of the infections, disinfection of instruments used during medical case handling, using personal protective equipment, proper and early diagnosis of the disease, avoiding contact with the sick patients, and quarantine of the infected/exposed people.},

	abstract = {We previously identified the major pathological changes in the respiratory and immune systems of patients who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}) but gained little information on the organ distribution of {SARS}-associated coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}). In the present study, we used a murine monoclonal antibody specific for {SARS}-{CoV} nucleoprotein, and probes specific for a {SARS}-{CoV} {RNA} polymerase gene fragment, for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, to detect {SARS}-{CoV} systematically in tissues from patients who died of {SARS}. {SARS}-{CoV} was found in lung, trachea/bronchus, stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland, liver and cerebrum, but was not detected in oesophagus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, heart, aorta, cerebellum, thyroid, testis, ovary, uterus or muscle. These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract and other organs with detectable {SARS}-{CoV} may also be targets of {SARS}-{CoV} infection. The pathological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the {SARS}-{CoV}; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection. In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, {SARS}-{CoV} in the intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces, urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission. This study provides important information for understanding the pathogenesis of {SARS}-{CoV} infection and sheds light on possible virus transmission pathways. This data will be useful for designing new strategies for prevention and treatment of {SARS}.},

	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}) is an acute respiratory disease with significant morbidity and mortality. While its clinical manifestations have been extensively studied, its pathogenesis is not yet fully understood. A limited number of autopsy studies have revealed that the lungs and the immune system are the organs that sustain the most severe damage. Other organs affected include the kidneys, brain, digestive tract, heart, liver, thyroid gland and urogenital tract. The primary target cells are pneumocytes and enterocytes, both cell types abundantly expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which is the main {SARS}-{CoV} receptor. Other cell types infected include the epithelial cells of renal tubules, cerebral neurons, and immune cells. The pathology of this disease results from both direct and indirect injury. Direct injury is caused by infection of the target cells by the virus. Indirect injury mainly results from immune responses, circulatory dysfunction, and hypoxia. In this review, we summarize the major pathological findings at the gross, cellular and molecular levels and discuss the various possible mechanisms that may contribute to the pathogenesis of {SARS}. The implications of the proposed pathogenesis for prevention, diagnosis and therapy of the disease are discussed.},

	abstract = {The revolution of genome sequencing is continuing after the successful second-generation sequencing ({SGS}) technology. The third-generation sequencing ({TGS}) technology, led by Pacific Biosciences ({PacBio}), is progressing rapidly, moving from a technology once only capable of providing data for small genome analysis, or for performing targeted screening, to one that promises high quality de novo assembly and structural variation detection for human-sized genomes. In 2014, the {MinION}, the first commercial sequencer using nanopore technology, was released by Oxford Nanopore Technologies ({ONT}). {MinION} identifies {DNA} bases by measuring the changes in electrical conductivity generated as {DNA} strands pass through a biological pore. Its portability, affordability, and speed in data production makes it suitable for real-time applications, the release of the long read sequencer {MinION} has thus generated much excitement and interest in the genomics community. While de novo genome assemblies can be cheaply produced from {SGS} data, assembly continuity is often relatively poor, due to the limited ability of short reads to handle long repeats. Assembly quality can be greatly improved by using {TGS} long reads, since repetitive regions can be easily expanded into using longer sequencing lengths, despite having higher error rates at the base level. The potential of nanopore sequencing has been demonstrated by various studies in genome surveillance at locations where rapid and reliable sequencing is needed, but where resources are limited.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new {DNA} sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including {MAQ}, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, {MAQ} does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of {MAQ} is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.
{RESULTS}: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool ({BWA}), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform ({BWT}), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. {BWA} supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from {AB} {SOLiD} machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that {BWA} is approximately 10-20x faster than {MAQ}, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, {BWA} outputs alignment in the new standard {SAM} (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source {SAMtools} software package.

The rapid genome sequencing of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 strains has become a helpful tool for better understanding the genomic characteristics and origin of the virus. To obtain virus whole-genome sequences directly from clinical specimens, we performed nanopore sequencing using a modified {ARTIC} protocol in a portable nanopore sequencer and validated a routine 8-h workflow and a 5-h rapid pipeline. We conducted some optimization to improve the genome sequencing workflow. The sensitivity of the workflow was also tested by serially diluting {RNA} from clinical samples. The optimized pipeline was finally applied to obtain the whole genomes of 29 clinical specimens collected in Hangzhou from January to March 2020. In the 29 obtained complete genomes of {SARS}-{CoV}-2, 33 variations were identified and analyzed. The genomic variations and phylogenetic analysis hinted at multiple sources and different transmission patterns during the {COVID}-19 epidemic in Hangzhou, China. In conclusion, the genomic characteristics and origin of the virus can be quickly determined by nanopore sequencing following our workflows.},

On the 30(th) of April, 64 days after this first diagnosis, the number of patients had increased exponentially, reaching 19 224 confirmed cases and 1859 (9.67\%) deaths. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the current state of our understanding regarding {COVID}-19 in Mexico. {METHODS}: We obtained the data from the official website of the Ministry of Health in Mexico. The study period was between the 27(th) of February and the 30(th) of April 2020. The cases were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and we analysed epidemiological, demographic and clinical data. {RESULTS}: In Mexico, most cases of {COVID}-19 were located in Mexico City. The mean age of the patients was 46 years. Of the 12 656 confirmed cases, most infected individuals were between the ages of 30 and 59 years (65.85\%), and there was a higher incidence rate in men (58.18\%) than in women (41.82\%). The patients who died had one or more comorbidities, mainly hypertension (45.53\%), diabetes (39.39\%) and obesity (30.4\%). In the first 64 days of the epidemic, China had reported 80 304 cases with a mortality rate of 3.66\%. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our results indicate an early transmission of {COVID}-19 in Mexico. The descriptive epidemiology shows similarities between the cases of {COVID}-19 in Mexico and those in China. In the same period of the epidemic curve, we observed a reduction in the number of confirmed cases of {COVID}-19 in Mexico and a higher mortality rate compared with that of China.},

Infection in humans results in a variety of outcomes ranging from asymptomatic cases to the disease {COVID}-19, which can have significant morbidity and mortality, with over two million confirmed deaths worldwide as of January 2021. Over a year into the pandemic, sequencing analysis has shown that variants of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 are being selected as the virus continues to circulate widely within the human population. The predominant drivers of genetic variation within {SARS}-{CoV}-2 are single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) caused by polymerase error, potential host factor driven {RNA} modification, and insertion/deletions (indels) resulting from the discontinuous nature of viral {RNA} synthesis. While many mutations represent neutral ‘genetic drift’ or have quickly died out, a subset may be affecting viral traits such as transmissibility, pathogenicity, host range, and antigenicity of the virus. In this review, we summarise the current extent of genetic change in {SARS}-{CoV}-2, particularly recently emerging variants of concern, and consider the phenotypic consequences of this viral evolution that may impact the future trajectory of the pandemic.,},

          We are bioinformatics trainees at the University of Michigan who started a local chapter of Girls Who Code to provide a fun and supportive environment for high school women to learn the power of coding. Our goal was to cover basic coding topics and data science concepts through live coding and hands-on practice. However, we could not find a resource that exactly met our needs. Therefore, over the past three years, we have developed a curriculum and instructional format using Jupyter notebooks to effectively teach introductory Python for data science. This method, inspired by The Carpentries organization, uses bite-sized lessons followed by independent practice time to reinforce coding concepts, and culminates in a data science capstone project using real-world data. We believe our open curriculum is a valuable resource to the wider education community and hope that educators will use and improve our lessons, practice problems, and teaching best practices.

	doi = {10.1101/2021.06.15.448091},
	abstract = {Inspired by well-established material and pedagogy provided by The Carpentries (Wilson 2016), we developed a two-day workshop curriculum that teaches introductory R programming for managing, analyzing, plotting and reporting data using packages from the tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019), the Unix shell, version control with git, and {GitHub}. While the official Software Carpentry curriculum is comprehensive, we found that it contains too much content for a two-day workshop. We also felt that the independent nature of the lessons left learners confused about how to integrate the newly acquired programming skills in their own work. Thus, we developed a new curriculum that aims to teach novices how to implement reproducible research principles in their own data analysis. The curriculum integrates live coding lessons with individual-level and group-based practice exercises, and also serves as a succinct resource that learners can reference both during and after the workshop. Moreover, it lowers the entry barrier for new instructors as they do not have to develop their own teaching materials or sift through extensive content. We developed this curriculum during a two-day sprint, successfully used it to host a two-day virtual workshop with almost 40 participants, and updated the material based on instructor and learner feedback. We hope that our new curriculum will prove useful to future instructors interested in teaching workshops with similar learning objectives.Competing Interest {StatementThe} authors have declared no competing interest.},
